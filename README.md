# ProjectBubbleSortAlgo
Bubble Sort was chosen because although its inefficient compared to other algorithms, the simplicity behind it means that it can easily and effectively be implemented

## demo video
in this video the program functions are shown in the order:
- load list (load input)
- handling empty, single value inputs
- handling formatting errors (missing value, integars, hanging comma)
- step by step sorting + step log
- instant sort (note: instant sort and step by step may differ in number of steps)
- reset

## Problem Breakdown and computational thinking
 this app implements Bubble sort inside an interactive Gradio UI where users can:
-  upload custom lists of integars
-  sort the list step by step
-  instantly sort all steps
-  track swaps and comparisons
this helps visualize and explain how bubble sort works
Four pillars of computational Thinking
1. Decomposition: break the problem down
  - formatting and error handling user input
  - performing individual Algorithm steps
  - instant sort
  - logging each operation
  - resetting to allow the app to be used repeatedly
2. pattern recognition
  - Bubble Sort Repeatedly compares adjacent values
  - Larger values "bubble" up
3. Abstraction
  - Complex operations (sorting logic, state handling) not shown
  - user only interacts with buttons and text prompts
  - only educational info shown (steps, comparisons, swaps)
4. Algorithmic thinking
  - Bubble Sort is modeled as a clear sequence of steps
  - control structures track index, loops and conditions (sorted, etc)
  - instant sort uses nested loop logic
  - step by step sorting represents the algorithm
## Steps to run
1. open the hugging face space using the link below
2. enter your input according to the instructions
3. press "next step" to interate through with bubble sort or "instant sort" to instantly sort the input
