# ProjectBubbleSortAlgo
## Bubble Sort was chosen because although its inefficient compared to other algorithms, the simplicity behind it means that it can easily and effectively be implemented
## Algorithm design
### the innerworkings of bubble sort are simple, the main task is formatting the input so the algorithm works every time without fail. firstly we want the input to uniform in the format "1,2,3" (i.e a list with only numbers and commas so we can use the the split and map methods to create a list of integars)
