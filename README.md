# ProjectBubbleSortAlgo
# I chose to do bubble sort because i can most effectively code the algorithm and most effectively explain the thought processes behind logical decisions, 
# i also chose Bubble sort because it only requires 1 input (unsorted list/array), whereas a search would require both desired value and a dataset
